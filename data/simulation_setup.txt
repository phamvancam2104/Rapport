opaqueBehavior for a created operation:
	"Class" + "Class" + random(1, numPkgs) + random(1, numClassPerPkg) + ";"
	Create dependency between the opaqueBehavior.owner (i.e. its Class) and "Class" + random(1, numPkgs) + random(1, numClassPerPkg)

numGeneralizations: 300

Some other things to consider later:
  - Enumeration
  - Default value for a primitive attribute or parameter
  - ?

Algorithm
=========

Apply C_Cpp profile
Import AnsiCLibrary

For p : 1 .. numPkgs by steps of 1
	Create "Package" + p
	For c : 1 .. numClasses by steps of 1
		Create "Class" + p + c
		For a : 1 .. numAttrPerClass
			If random() > probAttr
				Create "attribute" + a  for the class
				If random() > probPtr
					Apply <<Ptr>> to attribute
				end If
			End If
		End for
		// TODO: create operations, opaqueBehaviors, parameters
	End For
End For

// TODO create generalizations: Choose randomly Class1, choose randomly Class2, make Class1 inherit Class2, add Class1 to list of classes to not choose next time
// TODO loop through all properties and parameters, if random() > probPrimitive then type with a random primitive, else type with a random class in the model
// TODO loop through all properties and create associations from properties following aggregation rules (like in the reverse)

Discussion
==========

So the conclusion of this interesting discussion, that we will put in the paper, is:
1. We ensure semantic are identical (syntax too hard, haven't seen a tool that does that) (define semantic identical)
2. Eclipse techs are insufficient for an efficient impl of the whole process
3. The process can be re-used in different contexts, independently of the impl

Present this in the experiments and/or impl sections. Present some impl issues (like Eclipse techs are limited) as results
of the UML-RT case-study (a real usage of our impl of the process)

[‎04/‎04/‎2016 17:09] PHAM Van Cam: 
we also need to explain that the reversed and original models are not syntactically identical since the mapping between UML and C++ are not bijective (not always having 1-to-1 mappings)
and furthermore, some C++ features are not present in UMl
