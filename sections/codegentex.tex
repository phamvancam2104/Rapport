\section{A complete code generation solution for UML State Machine}
\label{sec:codegen}
This section describes a complete generation solution for UML State Machine, especially when considering the concurrency aspect. It first reminds background definitions in a formal way and some assumptions on output generated code. 
Subsection \ref{sec:thread} continues with the concurrency design for generated code based on multi-thread. 
Overview of a code generation approach based on the design is then discussed. %before a synchronization approach is introduced.

\subsection{Assumption}
%todo: give some assumptions on code generation such as functions to create methods, attriutes, classes
Assuming that we want to generate from the state machine to an object oriented programming language $ActLang$, which is C++-like and supports multi-threading as following functions and resource control as mutexes.
\begin{itemize}
	%\item $genClass(n, generals, itfs)$ creates a class with its name, parent class set, and implemented interfaces as \ti{n}, \ti{generals}, and \ti{itfs}.
	
	%\item $genMtd(n, c, type, params)$ creates a method $m$ with its name as $n$ inside the class $c$, its return type as $type$, and $params$ as its parameter set.
	
	%\item $genAttr(n, c, type, multiplicity)$ creates an attribute named $n$ in the class $c$ and typed by $type$. The create attribute is an array if $multiplicity > 1$, otherwise a simple attribute.
	
	%\item $genEnum(n)$ and $genEnumLit(enum, n)$ create an enumeration and its enumeration literal, respectively.
	
	%\item $genBody(m, body)$ adds a body to a method. The body is a string which contains a list of statements.
	
	%\item $createParalle(t, seg)$ generates a mechanism which allows the segment code $seg$ run in a thread $t$. Similarly, $genWait(t), genJoin(t)$.
	
	\item A mutex has three methods $lock$, $unlock$, and $wait$, which automatically unlocks the mutex and waits until it receives a signal.  
	
	%\item $synchronize(seg)$ generates a mechanism which allows the segment code $seg$ run safely (can be either based on \ti{POSIX pthread} or \ti{Java synchronize} mechanism).
	
	%\item $toString(stts)$ is used to convert a list of statements $stts$ into a readable string which can be add to a method as its body.
	
	%\item Concatenation of two strings $str1$ and $str2$ is concisely described as $str1 + str2$.
	
	%\item \ti{WHILE}, \ti{FOR} \ti{IF}, \ti{ELSE} are symbols representing while and for loops, if and else statements.
	
	\item \ti{FORK(func)} creates a thread (lightweight process) associated with the function/method \ti{func} and \ti{JOIN(theThread)} waits until the method associated with the thread \ti{theThread} completes.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Code generation pattern}

\subsubsection{State transformation}
%Suppose that we want to generate a state machine $sm$ whose states are listed by $lstates$. 
A common state interface $IState$ is created. The interface contains three methods, namely, \ti{entry}, \ti{exit}, and \ti{doActivity} respectively corresponding to three state actions. To preserve the hierarchy of composite states, the interface also has two attributes called \ti{actives} and \ti{previousActives} referring to current and previous active sub-states in case of the presence of history states, and a list of deferred event identifiers.

Each UML state is transformed into an instance of the interface associated with a state ID (which is a child element of an enumeration) inside the active class $C$. 
During initialization, each instance delegates its methods to suitable implementation, e.g. function pointers in C++. 
%In other object-oriented languages such as Java, this is done with anonymous sub-classes of the interface. 
For example, Listing \ref{lst:IStateCpp} in Appendix shows the interface and its instances. 
%The actions of the states are named depending on the name of the states. In the following sections, we only consider \ti{ActLang} as a C++-like. The discussion of other object-oriented languages are much similar since these share the same concepts.

Each \ti{doActivity} is associated with a permanent thread and a mutex. The \ti{doActivity} thread is initialized, waits for a start signal, executes the \ti{doActivity} code, generates a completion if the state is atomic and still active, and goes back to the waiting point as the paradigm above. Listing \ref{lst:doActivity} in Appendix shows a code segment for \ti{doActivity} threads.

\begin{comment}
The procedure to generate the code for states is shown in Listing \ref{lst:procedure1}. It first creates the state interface $IState$ (in C++, it is either a class or a struct). The array attribute is then created with the number of states as its size. Each state is also associated with a state ID which is a child of an enumeration. Finally, the constructor of $C$ is created to initialize and make methods of the attribute instances refer to \ti{entry/exit/doActivity} action methods of $C$. The implementation of action methods in the context class $C$ is similar to the delegation pattern proposed by the authors in \cite{Niaz2004} but dramatically decreases the memory consumption since only one common interface for all states is created instead of a class for each state in \cite{Niaz2004}.

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true, caption=Procedure to create code for states, label=lst:procedure1, frame=single]
IState = genClass('IState', $\emptyset$, $\emptyset$);
stateIdEnum = genEnum('StateIdEnum');
foreach s in lstates
  genEnumLit(stateIdEnum, s.name + '_ID');
  mtd = genMtd(s.name + '_entry', C, 
			null, null);
  genBody(mtd, toString(entry(s)));
  ...
genEnumLit(stateIdEnum, 'NUM_STATES');  
genAttr('states', C, IState, NUM_STATES); 
genMtd(C.name, C, null, null);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{comment}



\subsubsection{Region transformation}
\label{subsubsec:region-trans}
Each region is transformed into an entering and exiting method. 
While the entering method controls how a region $r$ is entered from an outside transition $t$ ($src(t) \notin vertices(r)$), the exiting method exits completely a region by executing exit actions of sub-states from innermost to outermost.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[clip, trim=0.2cm 0.2cm 0.2cm 0.2cm, width=1.0\columnwidth]{figures/EnteringStateExample.pdf}
	\caption{Example illustrating different ways entering a composite state} 
	\label{fig:entering}
\end{figure}

A region $r$ is entered by either a transition $t$ ending at the border of its containing state or on a sub-vertex (direct or indirect), depending on how the state machine is designed. 
The following lists different ways $r$ may be entered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Way 1: entering by default: $tgt(t) = owner(r) \wedge src(t) \notin vertices(r)$.
	
	\item Way 2: entering on a direct sub-vertex: $tgt(t) \in vertices(r) \wedge src(t) \notin vertices(r)$.
	
	\item Way 3: entering on an indirect sub-vertex: $owner(tgt(t)) \in vertices^+(r) \wedge src(t) \notin vertices(r)$.
\end{itemize} 

All of the entering ways execute the entry action of the containing composite state $entry(owner(r))$ after $effect(t)$. \ti{doActivity(owner(r))} is then signaled to be run in its associated thread. The actions afterwards are different for each way. To illustrate, we use an example as in Fig. \ref{fig:entering} with \ti{S1} as a target composite state. \ti{t1}, \ti{t3} and \ti{t6} are in the ways of 1 and 3, respectively, while \ti{t2, t5} in the way 2. 

The entering method associated with the region $r$ of \ti{S1} has a parameter $enter\_mode$ indicating how actions should be executed. The number of modes depends on the number of transitions coming to the composite state $S1$ specified as: $\#modes(s) = \\ \#\{v \in vertices(s)| v.kind=initial\} + \\ \#\{v \in vertices(s)| \exists t \in T_{ins}(v), src(t) \notin vertices(s)\} + \\ 
\#\{v \in vertices^+(s)\setminus vertices(s)|\exists t \in T_{ins}(v), src(t) \notin vertices^+(s)\}$. The detail of how these modes are implemented in specific languages are not discussed here. The readers are recommended to read the example in Listing \ref{lst:region} in Appendix. 

 

%For each value in $values(s)$, the region of $S1$ is entered and executes different actions. 

%Entering on a direct sub-state (\ti{S2}) sets the active sub-state of \ti{S1} directly to \ti{S2}. 
%In case of an indirect sub-state ($S4$), the entry action of $S3$ is executed before $S4$ is set as the active-sub state of $S3$ and the execution of $entry(S4)$. 


Transitioning from a vertex to a pseudo-state of the composite state (transition from $S0$ to $SH$ is a particular case) is not as simple as that of two states. It needs a systematic approach which generates code for a transition outgoing from a vertex to any other one. This is detailed in the next section.

\subsubsection{Event and transition transformation}
\label{subsec:event}
\paragraph{Events}
An event enumeration \ti{EventId} is created whose children are event identifiers associated with events. 
Each event $e$) is also transformed into a method $mtd_e$ in the context class $C$. 
%Suppose $levents$ is the list of events which can be processed by the state machine $sm$. 
Besides the explicitly defined events of the state machines, the event list contains a special event called $CompletionEvent$, which is implicitly implemented as an asynchronous \ti{CallEvent}. %The latter is, following the UML specification, an implicit event triggering triggerless transitions. It is emitted when either \ti{doActivity} of an atomic state finishes its execution or all regions of a composite state have reached to a final state. 
For each event type, the transformation is realized as followings:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \ti{CallEvent} $ce$: The associated operation $op(ce)$ can be either synchronous or asynchronous. When $op(ce)$ is called, it waits and locks the main mutex protecting the run-to-completion semantics, and executes $mtd_{ce}$. Contrarily, the parameters of the asynchronous operation are used to create a signal which is transformed similarly to the case of $SignalEvent$.
	
	\item \ti{SignalEvent} $se$: $SignalEvent$ is asynchronous. 
	The signal associated with $se$ is written into the event queue of the active class $C$ by an operation which takes as input the signal. 
	
	\item \ti{TimeEvent} $te$: A thread $teThread$ associated with $te$ is created and initialized at the initialization of the state machine. 
	Within the execution of $teThread$, the method associated with $te$ waits for a signal, which is sent after the execution of the entry of a state $s \in \{v \in V|\exists t \in T_{outs}(v), te \in events(t)\}$, to start sleeping for a duration $d$ of $te$. 
	When the duration expires, $te$ is emitted and written to the event queue if $s$ is still active.
	
	\item \ti{ChangeEvent} $che$: Similar to $TimeEvent$, a thread $cheThread$ is initialized at initialization but the associated method $mtd$ does not wait for a signal to start. $mtd$ periodically checks whether the value of the associated boolean expression $ex(che)$ changes by comparing the current value with the previous value. 
	If a change happen, $che$ is committed to the event queue.
	
	\item \ti{Any}: any of the above events can trigger the associated transitions.
\end{itemize}

As above presented, all asynchronous incoming events are stored in a FIFO priority queue, in which each event type has a configurable priority. $CompletionEvent$ always has the highest priority. 
Others are equal by default.

\paragraph{Transitions}

%To process events, for each event, a method is implemented in $C$. 
Each event is associated with a list of transitions. We suppose $T_{trig}(e)$ is the transition list, which can be triggered by the event $e$, and $S_{trig}(e) = \{src(t) | t \in T_{trig}(e)\}$. In other words, $S_{trig(e)}$ is a set of states which are the source states of the transitions in $T_{trig}(e)$. To present how the body of event methods is generated, we define functions as followings:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Vertex depth $dp(v)$ is defined as: $dp(v) = 1$ if v is a root vertex, otherwise $dp(v) = dp(owner(v)) + 1$.
	
	\item $Map_{e}(s) \subset S_{trig(e)} | \forall sub \in Map_e(s): owner(sub) = s$, $Prt(e) = \{s \in V| Map_{e}(v) \neq \emptyset\}$. $Prt(e)$ is an ordered list whose length is $len(Prt\{e\})$ and elements are accessed by index ($get$). The order of $Prt(e)$ is defined as:	$\forall i, j \leq len(Prt\{e\})$, 
	\\ if $i < j, dp(Prt(e).get(i)) \geq dp(Prt(e).get(j))$. 	
\end{itemize}

The procedure in Listing \ref{lst:eventproc} describes how the generation process works with an event. 
It first finds the innermost active states which are able to react $e$ by orderly looping over $Lm_e$. 
For each transition outgoing from an innermost state, code for active states and deferral events, guard checking and transition code segments are generated by $GENERATE\_STATE\_EVENT\_CHECK$, $GENERATE\_GUARD(t)$ and \ti{GENTRANS}, respectively. 
If the identifier of $e$ is equal to one of the events listed in $defEvents$ of the corresponding state (not shown in this paper), it is deferred by putting it to a deferral event queue managed by the main thread, which also pushes the deferred events back to the main queue once one of the pending events is processed. 

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true, caption=Generation process for an event, label=lst:eventproc, frame=single][H]
$\forall$ item $\in Lm(e)$
  $\forall s \in Map_e(item)$
    $T_s = \{t \in T_{trig}(e)|src(t) = s\}$
    $\forall t \in T_s$
      $GENERATE\_STATE\_EVENT\_CHECK(s, t, e)$
      $GENERATE\_GUARD(t)$
      $GENTRANS(s,t,tgt(t))$  	
\end{lstlisting}

Depending on the target of $t$, $GENERATE\_STATE\_EVENT\_CHECK$ can generate single or multiple active state checking code. 
The latter occurs if $tgt(t)$ is a $join$. 
The detailed discussion on these is not presented due to space limitation. Listing \ref{lst:event1}, line 1-2, shows an example for multiple checking.   

Generally, \ti{GENTRANS} generates code for transitions between any vertexes satisfying the constraints described in Section \ref{subsec:background}. The detail of \ti{GENTRANS} is not presented here. Each pseudo state is transformed as the followings:
%Algorithm \ref{alg:transitiongeneration} shows how the transition code generation works. The generated code is bounded by the deferral events, active states, and guard checking.

%In the first place, Algorithm \ref{alg:transitiongeneration} looks for the composite states $s_{ex}$ and $s_{en}$ at the highest level to be exited and entered (line 2-4), respectively. 
%If the transition $t$ is part of a compound transition, which involves some $junction$s, IF-ELSE statements are generated first (as PSCS says $junction$ is evaluated before any action). 
%The composite state is exited by calling the associated exiting region methods (FORK and JOIN for orthogonal regions) and followed by the generated code of transition effects. Entering region methods are then called once the above code completes the execution. If the target $v_t$ of the transition $t$ is a pseudo state, the generation algorithm corresponding to the pseudo state type is called. These algorithms are shown as the below list. 
 

%It generates the code checking for active states respecting the UML semantics in which the innermost states process the incoming event first. To do this, it first looks in the source state list $S_{trig(e)}$ for the innermost states that accept the event triggering its outgoing transitions. If these found states are children of a concurrent state, $genStateCheck$ generates the checking codes run in parallel, which will be described later in \ref{subsubsec:thread}. Otherwise said, sequential code is generated.

\begin{itemize}
	\item $join$: Use $GENTRANS$ for $v$'s outgoing transition.
	
	\item $fork$: Use $FORK$ and $JOIN$ for each of outgoing transitions of $v$.
	
	\item $choice$: For each outgoing, an $IF-ELSE$ is generated for the guard of the outgoing together with code generated by $GENTRANS$ (see Listing \ref{lst:event1}).
	
	\item $junction$: As a static version $choice$, a $junction$ is doubly evaluated. The first evaluation is before any action executed in compound transitions (see Listing \ref{lst:event1}). The output value of the first evaluation is used to determine which transition outgoing from $junction$ is taken in a second evaluation. %is transformed into an attribute $junc_attr$ and evaluated before . 
	%The value of $junc_attr$ is then used to choose the appropriate transition at the place of $junction$.
	
	\item \ti{shallow history}: The identifiers of states to be exited are kept in $pres$ of $IState$. Restoring the active states using the history is exampled as in Listing \ref{lst:region}. The entering method is executed as default mode at the first time the corresponding composite state is entered (see Listing \ref{lst:region}). The previous active sub-states are updated by saving the active state identifier to \ti{previousActives} before exiting the region containing the history.
	
	\item \ti{deep history}: Saving and restoring active states are done at all state hierarchy levels from the composite state containing the deep history down to atomic states. Updating \ti{pres} is committed before exiting the region, which is directly or indirectly contained by a parent state, in which a deep history is present.  
	
	\item $enpoint$: If $enpoint$ has no outgoing transition, the corresponding composite state is entered by default. Otherwise said, $GENTRANS$ is called to generate code for the outgoing transition.
	
	\item $expoint$: The code for the unique transition outgoing from $expoint$ is generated by using $GENTRANS$.
	
	\item $terminate$: The code executes the exit action of the innermost active state, the effect of the transition and destroys the state machine object.
\end{itemize}

%\subsubsection{Example Code} Listing \ref{lst:event1} shows a code segment generated. %for the processing of $verifyingPIN$. Single checking (line 1) checks whether $Idle$ is the current active state, in which $activeStateID$ is the identifier of the current root active state. The $doActivity$ behavior of $Idle$ is then stopped upon receiving a stop signal. The effect of $t2$, $effect(t3)$ and $effect(t4)$ are then executed after $exit(Idle)$. The execution of $emtry(Verifying)$ then follows the changing of root active state to $Verifying$. $doActivity(Verifying)$ is triggered and followed by concurrently entering the two orthogonal regions of $Verifying$ with appropriate modes.

%The discussion of Listing \ref{lst:event1} is similar to Listing \ref{lst:event} except that a multiple checking is executed (line 1-2) instead of a single one. The evaluation for $Junction1$ is executed (line 4) before any other actions (semantic conformance) to decide the decision should be taken (line 10-17).
