\section{Experiments and Evaluations}
\label{sec:experiments}

This section reports our experiments with the proposed model-code synchronization approach
and its implementation
based on Eclipse technologies.
The contributions are applied for UML and C++.
Two experiments have been conducted in order to assess the proposed methodology and
its applicability to the development of a realistic system.
In the following subsections, we first describe the results of some simulations designed
to test the proposed approach. Next, we report on a realistic case-study intended to help us assess certain scalability and usability aspects.

In the following section we relate both our work, including the implementation, to
existing approaches and tools presented in the literature.
